# bazel-module-federation

Proof of concept for using Bazel to back a webpack module federation website

## Setup

1. `yarn` for local development
1. `yarn bazel COMMAND` for running any bazel based commands

It is recommended you use [StackBuild plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=StackBuild.bazel-stack-vscode) for VSCode to get good Bazel integration.
